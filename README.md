# Ansible

Playbooks created for setup my laptops and desktops (Linux and MacOS).

## Requirements

### Linux
Install `git` and `ansible`

**WARN**
For some strange reason on PopOS the Ansible version shipped with apt is not as updated as debian version. Please install Ansible through official documentation.


### Mac OS
Install `homebrew` and `ansible`

## TO-DO
- Windows??
